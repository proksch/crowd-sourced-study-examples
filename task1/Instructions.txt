This task is about implementing a JSON parser for arbitrary objects.

The tests in "tests\SerializerTest" show an example usage of the
"Serializer" class of the file "Serializer.cs". 
Feel free to add further tests.
You only have to implement the "Serialize" method.

These are the requirements of the method:

1. null values should be ignored
2. there should be no default values, if a value is not present just ignore it

Time Guideline: 10 minutes
