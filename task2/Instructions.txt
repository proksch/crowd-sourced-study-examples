This task is about implementing a MetaDataReader for PDF files 
which can read arbitrary meta data fields.

The tests in "tests\MetaDataReaderTests" show an example usage of the
"MetaDataReader" class of the file "MetaDataReader.cs". 
You only have to implement the "ReadEntry" method.

These are the requirements of the method:

1. return the given meta data field by its name
2. if the meta data is not present return an empty string
