The file PDFMeta.cs contains the code skeleton for this task.

Look into the tests in "test\PDFTest.cs" and implement the getAuthor() method 
in the "PDFMeta" class accordingly.

You do not have to think about loading the PDF. This is already done by the test initialization.
The only thing you have to do is to extract the PDF's author and return it in the method.


HINTS:
The author's key in the MetaData Dictionary of the PDF is "Author".
